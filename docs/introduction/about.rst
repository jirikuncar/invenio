.. _introduction-about:

What is Invenio?
----------------

Invenio is a `free`_ software suite enabling you to run your own
`digital library`_ or document repository on the web. The technology
offered by the software covers all aspects of digital library management
from document ingestion through classification, indexing, and curation to
dissemination. Invenio complies with standards such as the
`Open Archives Initiative`_ metadata harvesting protocol (OAI-PMH) and uses
`MARC 21`_ as its underlying bibliographic format. The flexibility and
performance of Invenio make it a comprehensive solution for management of
document repositories of moderate to large sizes (several millions of
records).

Invenio has been originally developed at `CERN`_ to run the
`CERN document server`_, managing over 1,000,000 bibliographic records in
high-energy physics since 2002, covering articles, books, journals,
photos, videos, and more. Invenio is being co-developed by an
international collaboration comprising institutes such as `CERN`_,
`DESY`_, `EPFL`_, `FNAL`_, `SLAC`_ and is being used by about
thirty scientific institutions worldwide (see `demo`_).

If you would like to try it out yourself, please download our latest
version. If you have any questions about the software or the support
behind it, please join our `mailing lists`_ or `contact us`_.
